 <h1 style="position: absolute;left: 50px;top: 600px;font-size:20px;font-weight: 50;">Can my employer legally discriminate against me for being LGBTQ?</h1>


 <p style="font-weight: 50;position: absolute;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;top: 650px;font-size:17px;">No. Both the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act (Title VII) make it illegal for an employer to fire, demote, fail to hire, fail to promote, harass, or otherwise discriminate against you (such as by paying a lower wage or denying benefits that other workers receive) because of your sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression.</p>

 <h1 style="position: absolute;left: 50px;top: 800px;font-size:20px;font-weight: 50;">Are there any exceptions to the rule that California and federal laws protect all LGBTQ workers?</h1>

  <p style="font-weight: 50;position: absolute;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;top: 850px;font-size:17px;">The majority of employees in California are covered under these laws, but there are a few types of employees that are exempt from the laws:</p>

    <p style="font-weight: 50;position: absolute;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;top: 900px;font-size:17px;">Certain employees of religious entities like churches and mosques; and</p>


    <p style="font-weight: 50;position: absolute;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;top: 950px;font-size:17px;">Employees of very small employers. California discrimination protections described here apply to entities with at least 5 employees (and the harassment provisions apply to every entity, even if you are the only employee); and federal discrimination protections apply to entities with at least 15 employees.</p>


 <h1 style="position: absolute;left: 50px;top: 1050px;font-size:20px;font-weight: 50;">Can my employer harass me for being LGBTQ?</h1>

     <p style="font-weight: 50;position: absolute;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;top: 1100px;font-size:17px;">No. Harassment is a form of discrimination that occurs when an employer (or a co-worker with the employerâ€™s knowledge) subjects you to a hostile, offensive, or intimidating work environment because of your sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression. To be illegal, the behavior must be unwelcome and so harmful that it interferes with your ability to do your job. The law protects you from harassment by supervisors, coworkers, or even customers and third parties.</p>

     <h1 style="position: absolute;left: 50px;top: 1200px;font-size:20px;font-weight: 50;">Is my employer required to respect my non-binary identity?</h1>

        <p style="font-weight: 50;position: absolute;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;top: 1250px;font-size:17px;">Yes. California law recognizes gender non-conforming and non-binary identities and requires that employers respect all gender identities and expressions.</p>
